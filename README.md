This project implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning models to detect network intrusions. The system utilizes two popular datasets for network security research: the KDD Cup 99 and the NSL-KDD datasets. The machine learning models employed in this project are Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF).

Key Features
Datasets: KDD Cup 99 and NSL-KDD
Models: Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF)
Performance Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score
Datasets
KDD Cup 99 Dataset
The KDD Cup 99 dataset is a widely used dataset for evaluating IDS systems. It contains a variety of network intrusion types, including attacks such as DOS, R2L, U2R, and probing.

KDD Cup 99 Dataset
NSL-KDD Dataset
The NSL-KDD dataset is an improved version of the KDD Cup 99 dataset, addressing some of the issues present in the original dataset, such as redundant records and unbalanced class distributions.
